## 2.1 Write your observations from the above. 

1. Size of the dataset
2. What type of data attributes are there?
3. What are you classifying?
4. Plot the distribution of the categories of the target / label. 


# 1. Size of the dataset
In training dataset size is as follows :-

number of horses = 500

number of humans = 527

Total size of training data = 1027 images of horses and humans. 

In testing dataset size is as follows :-

number of horses = 128

number of humans = 128

Total size of testing data = 256 images of horses and humans.

2. Types of data attributes 
For the "horses vs humans" dataset, the attributes associated with each image are not defined or with the dataset.The dataset primarily consists of images of horses and humans without any attributes. However we can extract some attributes using deep learning model. Some of the attributes can be Pixel values, shape features, text features etc. Images contain rendered images of horses and humans in RGB format

3. What are you classifying ?
For the "horses vs humans" dataset, the typical task is to perform binary classification, distinguishing between images of horses and images of humans. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new unseen images as either a horse or a human.

4. Plot the distribution of target varaible
From above plot we notice that there are more number of humans as compared to horses in training dataset.

1. Image Resizing: The images in the dataset are resized to a desired input shape (150x150). Resizing helps to standardize the image dimensions, ensuring consistency in the input size for the model.
2. Image Normalization: The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range of 0 to 1. This is achieved by dividing each pixel value by 255.0. Normalizing the pixel values helps to bring them to a common scale and assists in faster convergence during training.

## 3.3 Split the data into training set and testing set

Mention the method adopted  and justify why the method was used
* to remove duplicate data, if present 
* to impute or remove missing data, if present 
* to remove data inconsistencies, if present 
* to encode categorical data

## 5.1 Configure the training

Configure  the model for training, by using appropriate optimizers and regularizations

Compile with categorical CE loss and metric accuracy.
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD

# Create SGD optimizer
sgd = SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Compile the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and metric accuracy
model.compile(optimizer=sgd, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## 5.2 Train the model

Train Model with cross validation, with total time taken shown for 20 epochs.

Use SGD.
import time
##---------Type the code below this line------------------##
import time

optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])

start_time = time.time()
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    epochs=20,
    verbose=1,
    validation_data=validation_generator
)
end_time = time.time()

total_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Total time for training: {total_time}")

## Justify your choice of optimizers and regulizations used and the hyperparameters tuned
Choice and Justification:

Optimizer:

Choice: SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer.
Justification: SGD is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and widespread use in neural network training. It updates model parameters based on gradients computed from mini-batches of the training data. The learning rate is set to 0.01 for efficient parameter updates.
Regularization:

Choice: Implicit regularization through dropout layers.
Justification: While no explicit regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization are used, dropout layers are included in the model architecture. Dropout acts as implicit regularization by randomly dropping neurons during training, reducing co-adaptation and preventing overfitting. This helps the model generalize well to unseen data.
Hyperparameters Tuned:

Hyperparameters: Learning rate and number of epochs.
Justification: The learning rate is set to 0.01, a common initial value for SGD optimization. It determines the step size for parameter updates. The number of epochs is set to 20 to strike a balance between underfitting and overfitting. This allows the model to learn from the data without excessive training.
Overall, the chosen optimizer, implicit regularization through dropout, and reasonable hyperparameter settings provide a good starting point for training the model. These choices balance simplicity, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. Fine-tuning and experimentation with the hyperparameters may be required to achieve optimal performance for the specific dataset and problem at hand.

## Comparison and conlusion of models
Comparison and Observations:

Model 5, which includes a dropout layer (ratio 0.25) and L2 regularization (factor 1e-04), achieved the highest validation and test accuracy. This indicates that the regularization techniques helped improve generalization performance, reducing overfitting.

Model 4, which includes only a dropout layer (ratio 0.25), also performed reasonably well with a similar test accuracy, but without the regularization term.

Models 1, 2, 6, and 7, which used different optimizers or made architectural changes, did not show significant improvement compared to the baseline (Model 1) in terms of accuracy. Their test accuracy remained at 0.5, indicating poor performance.

Model 3, which increased one layer from the baseline, showed a slightly higher test accuracy than the baseline but still performed relatively poorly compared to Models
